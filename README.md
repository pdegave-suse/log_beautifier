# Rancher & RKE2 Audit Log Beautifier / Parser

- A simple Terminal User Interface (TUI) tool that makes **Rancher** and **RKE2 (WIP)** audit logs easier to read and analyze.

- Raw audit logs are typically long, unformatted JSON lines that are difficult to inspect manually. This tool transforms them into a clean, searchable table and provides formatted JSON views for deeper inspection.

---

##  Features :

* **Table View:** It takes the JSON and shows the important data (Time, User, Code, URI) in columns.

* **Color Highlights:** Successful HTTP status code(200) are green and errors (4xx/5xx) are red, so you can spot problems quickly.

* **Search:** Filter logs instantly by Username, HTTP status code, URL / URI, timestamp

* **Detailed JSON View:** Select any log entry and press **Enter** to see the fully formatted JSON payload for detailed inspection.

##  Getting Started :

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdegave-suse/log_beautifier.git
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd log_beautifier
```

### 3️⃣ Make the Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Tool

```bash
./run.sh <audit-file-name>
```

The script will automatically:
- Set up the Python virtual environment
- Install required dependencies (`textual` and `rich`)

## Using a Custom Log File : 

To analyze a specific audit log file:

```bash
./run.sh path/to/your/file.log
```

 >> Note : Sample **rancher-api-audit.log** file is available in project `data' directory and currently the 'rancher-api-audit.log path is hardcoded in main.py.
